## Pommade

A little app to check your hair. Built with Electron.

## Running

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` to run as a menu bar
3. `npm start:detached` to run as a detached window. Kinda handy for debugging


## Tauri Implementation

I've also implemented it in Tauri, which is an electron alternative that doesn't ship Chromium. Pretty neat.

It uses the same codebase for now. I should probably pick one.

Run with `npm run tauri dev`
